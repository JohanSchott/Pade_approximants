Green's function for the Hubbard model on the Bethe-lattice with no on-site Coulomb interaction (U=0):

G(z) = 2*z*(1-sqrt(1-z^(-2)))

with the corresponding spectral function

rho(w) = -1/pi*Im[G(w+i*0^+)] = 2/pi*sqrt(1-w^2) 

The input data, at the Matsubara axis, is evaluated for beta = 100.
The real-axis data is evaluated 0.01 above the real-axis.
