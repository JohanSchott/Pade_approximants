#Analytic continuation settings
#ftype. 0 for Fermion, 1 for Susceptibility, 2 for Self-energy and 3 for Weird Fermion. 
#f(z)=b+int 1/(z-w)*rho(w)dw. Asymptotics: f(i*w_n) \approx b-a/w_n^2-i*s/w_n, with s=int rho(w)dw
#Fermion: rho(w)>=0. b=0, s=1. a can be estimated but it's not used in the fitting. Can have a second argument, if it's .false. , s=1 condition is removed
#Susceptibility: sgn(w)*rho(w)>=0. b=0. s and a can be estimated but are not used in fitting.
#Self-energy: sgn(w)*rho(w)>=0. b,s and a can be estimated but only b is used in fitting.
#Weird Fermion: rho(w)>=0. b,s and a can be estimated and all are used in fitting.
