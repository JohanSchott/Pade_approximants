Noninteracting Green's function of an edge atom of a nanoribbon, having a honeycomb lattice for the Haldane model. 
The spectral function contains many Van Hove singularities which makes it a very challenging test for analytic continuation. 
$\beta = 100$, in units of mRy, and Hamiltonian hopping parameter ratio is $\lambda/t = 0.1$.
The exact real-axis data is evaluated really close to the real-axis, in order to resolve the sharp peaks.
But for the analytical continuations a finite broadening is used.
