*
*> \par Purpose:
*  =============
*>
*> \verbatim
*>
*> dlabadquad takes as input the values computed by dlamchquad for underflow and
*> overflow, and returns the square root of each of these values if the
*> log of LARGE is sufficiently large.  This subroutine is intended to
*> identify machines with a large exponent range, such as the Crays, and
*> redefine the underflow and overflow limits to be the square roots of
*> the values computed by dlamchquad.  This subroutine is needed because
*> dlamchquad does not compensate for poor arithmetic in the upper half of
*> the exponent range, as is found on a Cray.
*> \endverbatim
*
*  Arguments:
*  ==========
*
*> \param[in,out] SMALL
*> \verbatim
*>          SMALL is real*16
*>          On entry, the underflow threshold as computed by dlamchquad.
*>          On exit, if LOG10(LARGE) is sufficiently large, the square
*>          root of SMALL, otherwise unchanged.
*> \endverbatim
